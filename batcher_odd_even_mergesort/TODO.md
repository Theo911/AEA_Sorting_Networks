# Batcher's Odd-Even Mergesort Project TODO

## Completed ✅
- [x] Create core implementation in `batcher_odd_even_mergesort.py`
- [x] Implement visualization module in `visualization.py`
- [x] Implement performance analysis in `performance_analysis.py`
- [x] Implement network properties analysis in `network_properties.py`
- [x] Write comprehensive documentation

## Testing 🧪
- [ ] Test with inputs of size 2^n (4, 8, 16, 32)
- [ ] Test with non-power-of-2 inputs (3, 5, 7, 10)
- [ ] Verify zero-one principle holds for n ≤ 8
- [ ] Check performance metrics match theoretical bounds

## Analysis Tasks 📊
- [ ] Compare actual depth with theoretical depth values
- [ ] Verify comparator count matches (n/2)log²(n) bound
- [ ] Analyze comparative performance against other sorting networks
- [ ] Benchmark execution time for various input sizes

## Visualization Improvements 🎨
- [ ] Add interactive visualization options
- [ ] Generate animated GIFs for step-by-step execution
- [ ] Add color coding for active comparators
- [ ] Create web-based interactive demo

## Future Extensions 🚀
- [ ] Implement parallel execution functionality
- [ ] Add circuit diagram generation for hardware implementation
- [ ] Compare with other sorting networks (Bitonic, AKS, etc.)
- [ ] Create optimized versions for specific input sizes
- [ ] Implement advanced optimizations to reduce comparator count
- [ ] Explore applications in parallel computing environments

## Documentation 📝
- [ ] Add more detailed mathematical proofs
- [ ] Include section on hardware implementation considerations
